I am an MMath Mathematics student at the University of St Andrews. My studies are focused on statistics and pure mathematics, particularly in Bayesian analysis, applied statistics and machine learning, and abstract algebra. I also have a strong interest in computer science, for which I have taken theoretical computer science courses within the mathematics department, as well as focused on computational modules in the rest of my course and interned as a software engineer.

I am currently working on my dissertation - supervised by Dr Jochen Kursawe - which is focused on applying Bayesian analysis to stochastic oscillators in single-cell gene-expression data. As well as continuing my work with Prof. Edward Wallace (University of Edinburgh), using proteomics data and automated analysis to investigate secretion pathways in fungi.
